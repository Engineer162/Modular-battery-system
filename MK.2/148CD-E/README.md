# 148CD-E MK.2

The 148CD-E MK.2 is the extended version of the 148CD. The extended version is a 296-watt-hour battery that has a nominal voltage of approximately 14.8 volts. Each cell has a capacity of 10000 mAh, or 10 Ah, with 4 in parallel to make a 4S module. However, because it is the extended version it features an additional battery module in the housing acting in a "slave" mode, thus making it a 2x148Wh module, which also makes the total battery module length longer. Additionally it being the CD or "cooling ducts" model, it features long ducts running through the housing to act as a way to cool off the battery in an enviroment that allows it. With it being the MK.2 it has a communication interface on top of the XT60 connector. Where through the interface, information about the battery like temperature, battery power level, cycles, health, battery model number, capacity and so on can be pulled so that the end system has an idea of what battery configuration it is dealing with.
